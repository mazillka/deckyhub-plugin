    Decky Loader runs plugins under a PyInstaller-bundled Python whose OpenSSL was
    compiled on a Debian-style system and looks for certificates under
    /usr/lib/ssl. SteamOS is Arch-based, so that directory does not exist, the
    default context ends up trusting nobody, and every fetch fails with
    "CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED: unable to get local issuer certificate".

    So: build the normal verifying context, and only when it came up with no
    certificates at all, load a CA bundle from a known location. Verification
    stays on - this fixes where the trusted roots are read from, not whether
    they are checked. An expired, self-signed or hostname-mismatched certificate
    still fails, exactly as before.
